    <string name="comp_iso_intro">Compound vs. Isolation Movements</string>
    <string name="comp_iso_desc"><b>Compound Movements</b> recruit a wide variety of muscle groups, stabilizer muscles,
    and tend to be much more taxing on the body and central nervous system. As such, it is best to perform these types of
    movements at the beginning of every workout, since this is when the body is able to provide the highest amount of output.
    Examples of compound movements are as follows:\n\n
        - Bench Press\n
        - Squats\n
        - Deadlifts\n
        - Pull ups\n
    <b>Isolation Movements</b> differ from compound movements in that they typically target one muscle group, are normally
    done for higher reps, and don\'t require as much output, making them much less taxing on the body and central nervous system.
    It it best to place these types of movements at the end of your workout since this is the point where you are running
    out of energy, but are still able to squeeze out a few more reps. Examples of isolation movements are as follows:\n
        - Bicep curl\n
        - Lateral Raise\n
        - Skullcrushers\n
        - Chest Flys\n
