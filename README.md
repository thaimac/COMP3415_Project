# Overview

Investing. Personal finance. Security Analysis. All captivating topics, am I right? Unless you’re the minority who honestly enjoys a good dive into a 10-K report or a healthy portfolio rebalance every quarter, I assume the answer to the above question is no. And that’s okay. Many of these topics contain the fun equivalent of a trip to the dentist twice a year. But just like the dentist, future you will thank you for putting in the work today.

The question remains, however. With all the various places for a person to park their money, where does one even start? Should I be putting my money in stocks? Bonds? GIC’s? Value? Growth? What even is a GIC? These are all valid questions that unfortunately may overwhelm and ultimately lead to another year with working towards a bountiful financial future being swept under the rug. 

In 2021, should making your money go to work for you really be this complicated? I don’t think so. That’s where PieBuilder comes in.

# Objective

PieBuilder is an app designed to first and foremost understand you, the user. We do this by asking various questions in an attempt to probe into what you are looking to get out of investing, such as return expectations, time horizon, risk tolerance, etc. We then analyze your answers and build you a personalized, one of a kind portfolio, recommending various stocks, index funds, etc. that are best suited to your situation. 

Our ultimate mission here at PieBuilder is to strip all the clutter and superfluities that exist in the financial space and provide the user with a clear and concise game plan designed to allow them to prosper in their individual situation.  We do this in hopes of providing our users not only with the confidence, knowledge and guidance required to succeed in their investment goals, but also to show them that it’s not so complicated after all.

# Software Design Pattern

The software design pattern utilized in this application was the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. The implementation of this looks as follows:

# Investment Profile Matching

Although many methods for matching a user with a certain investment profile were considered, the one that proved to be the most accurate and considerate was that of a point system. This system assigns a certain number of points to each answer - or range of answers (in the case of age, etc) - and tally's them up at the end. The result of this tallying is what will be used to fit a user into a certain investment profile. 

For example, if a user exhibits a very conservative and risk averse personality, then the end result of their answers will be a low number of points. In the point system, a low number of point implies a low risk tolerance and a conservative investment personality. As such, this particular user will be presented with a number of low risk investments. On the contrary, if a user appears to be comfortable with a higher level of risk taking, then the back end will assign more points to their answers and they will be presented with a number of higher risk investments. 

Variables such as age and time horizon also play a role in the point system, since, if your older or if your time horizon is miniscule, then high risk investments are not advisable since they are accompanied by significant volatility, and it is anyone's guess as to what side of the swing (high or low) the asset will be on when the user needs to withdraw their money. So older age and a shorter time horizon are characterized by lower points, while a younger age and longer time horizon are characterized by higher ones.
