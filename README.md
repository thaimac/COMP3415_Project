# Overview

Investing. Personal finance. Security Analysis. All captivating topics, am I right? Unless you’re the minority who honestly enjoys a good dive into a 10-K report or a healthy portfolio rebalance every quarter, I assume the answer to the above question is no. And that’s okay. Many of these topics contain the fun equivalent of a trip to the dentist twice a year. But just like the dentist, future you will thank you for putting in the work today.

The question remains, however. With all the various places for a person to park their money, where does one even start? Should I be putting my money in stocks? Bonds? GIC’s? Value? Growth? What even is a GIC? These are all valid questions that unfortunately may overwhelm and ultimately lead to another year with working towards a bountiful financial future being swept under the rug. 

In 2021, should making your money go to work for you really be this complicated? I don’t think so. That’s where PieBuilder comes in.

# Objective

PieBuilder is an app designed to first and foremost understand you, the user. We do this by asking various questions in an attempt to probe into what you are looking to get out of investing, such as return expectations, time horizon, risk tolerance, etc. We then analyze your answers and build you a personalized, one of a kind portfolio, recommending various stocks, index funds, etc. that are best suited to your situation. 

Our ultimate mission here at PieBuilder is to strip all the clutter and superfluities that exist in the financial space and provide the user with a clear and concise game plan designed to allow them to prosper in their individual situation.  We do this in hopes of providing our users not only with the confidence, knowledge and guidance required to succeed in their investment goals, but also to show them that it’s not so complicated after all.

# Software Design Pattern

The software design pattern utilized in this application was the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. The implementation of this looks as follows:
